# Interactive-Chord-Diagram-using-chord-package

Created an interactive Chord diagram using the Chord package to visualize the number of lines exchanged between 2 characters. The size of the arc represents the total extent of each character's interactions with other characters' arcs.

You can check out the Chord diagram I created at https://swarnitav08.github.io/Interactive-Chord-Diagram-using-chord-package/ hosted on Github pages.

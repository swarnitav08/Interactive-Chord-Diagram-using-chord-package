# Interactive-Chord-Diagram-using-chord-package

Created an interactive Chord diagram using the chord package to visualize the number of lines exchanged between 2 characters. The size of the arc represents the total extent of each character's interactions with other characters' arcs.

You can check out the Chord diagram I created at https://swarnitav08.github.io/Interactive-Chord-Diagram-using-chord-package/ hosted on Github pages.

This repository is a part of the visualizations under "The Office Story" project; you can view the project's repo here - https://github.com/swarnitav08/The-Office-Story

## Screenshots:
As far as I have observed the link is best viewed when your browser zoom level is at 100%. The link when opened via Chrome browser on my laptop looks like this(the formatting might change based on different browsers, hence attaching screenshots of how it is supposed to look)-
